    "* `act()`: Change the state of a job to a given state (remove, hold, suspend, etc).\n",
    "\n",
    "Both methods take a _job specification_: either a ClassAd expression (such as `Owner=?=\"janedoe\"`)\n",
    "or a list of job IDs (such as `[\"1.1\", \"2.2\", \"2.3\"]`).  The `act` method takes an argument\n",
    "from the `JobAction` enum.  Commonly-used values include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Hold`: put a job on hold, vacating a running job if necessary.  A job will stay in the hold\n",
    "   state until explicitly acted upon by the admin or owner.\n",
    "* `Release`: Release a job from the hold state, returning it to Idle.\n",
