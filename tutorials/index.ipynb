    "# HTCondor Python Bindings Tutorials\n",
    "\n",
    "The HTCondor Python bindings provide a powerful mechanism to interact with HTCondor from a Python program.\n",
    "They utilize the same C++ libraries as HTCondor itself, meaning they have nearly the same behavior as the command line tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, you will learn the basics of the Python bindings and how to use them. \n",
    "The tutorials are broken down into a few major sections:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Users**, an guide to the features that users who want to submit and manage jobs will find most useful. Start here if you're a user who wants to submit jobs from Python.\n",
    "- **Introduction**, a quick overview of the major components for administrators and advanced users. Start here if you want to know where all the bits and pieces are. Each learning module is meant to be done in sequence.\n",
    "- **Advanced**, an in-depth examination of the nooks and crannies of the system. Each module is standalone; read only those that look interesting to you.\n",
