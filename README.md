# HTCondor Python Bindings Tutorials

This repository contains various tutorials on using the HTCondor Python Bindings.

The easiest way to get started is to launch the tutorials via Binder: 
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/htcondor/htcondor-python-bindings-tutorials/stable?urlpath=lab/tree/index.ipynb)

The Binder link above is for the version of the tutorials based on the **stable** series release of HTCondor, currently `8.8.x`.
If you want the tutorials based on the **development** series (`8.9.x`), use [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/htcondor/htcondor-python-bindings-tutorials/dev?urlpath=lab/tree/index.ipynb).

If you are a maintainer, see the `MAINTENANCE.md` file for instructions.

## Other Ways to Access the Tutorials

If Binder isn't working, there are three (worse) ways to get the tutorials.

### Run in a Docker Container

You can run the same Docker container used by Binder locally by running
```bash
docker run --rm htcondor/python-bindings-tutorials:stable
```
Replace `stable` with `dev` if you want the development series release.
After Docker pulls the image and starts it, you should see something like
```

    To access the notebook, open this file in a browser:
        file:///home/jovyan/.local/share/jupyter/runtime/nbserver-1-open.html
    Or copy and paste one of these URLs:
        http://(sdfa0sjgk01k or 127.0.0.1):8888/?token=sidfj12312ejr01039ir4029f0qr34i0284utfr9ja909fi2
```
Paste one of the URL options into your web browser and you'll be in a Jupyter Lab.
Use the file browser to open `index.ipynb`.


### Run in a Docker Container (From a Local Repository)

The Docker container that runs on Binder is defined by `binder/Dockerfile`.
You can run this container locally.

Clone the repository:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor-python-bindings-tutorials
```
(The default is the stable series; `git checkout dev` to switch to development after cloning.)

Run the `run.sh` script, which builds and runs the Docker image and container:
```bash
$ chmod +x binder/run.sh  # you only need to do this once
$ binder/run.sh
```
You'll see the output of the Docker image build, then the container will spin up and you'll see a message like above.
Use it to connect to the Jupyter Lab and open `index.ipynb`.


### Run on Bare Metal

Install your preferred version of HTCondor on your computer (https://research.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor/downloads/).

Clone the repository as above.

Install JupyterLab and the matching version of the Python bindings into your Python using `pip`:
```bash
$ pip install jupyterlab htcondor==<x.y>
```
where `<x.y>` is something like `8.8`.

Run JupyterLab from the repository root:
```bash
$ jupyter lab
```
and use your web browser to access the Jupyter Lab and open `index.ipynb` as above.
